# Android-Feature-Branches

The Master Branch is plain vanilla blank activity.

"Feature branches" will add the new feature(s) in a single commit, so we can use the git-diff to see all
of changes and files to apply them onto into a single page.

This will make it much easier to read which changes you will need to each feature.

Feel free to pull-request, and add feature branches of your own : )
